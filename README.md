# Analytics Project
## 1st phase objectives
- Read data from a file : the file `resources/symptoms.txt` contains a list of symptoms, unordered, one per line.
- Count all the occurrences of every single symptom of the file.
- Generate a new file named `results.out` which will list each symptom, ordered alphabetically, and followed with the
number of occurrences for each symptom.
> #### Example :
